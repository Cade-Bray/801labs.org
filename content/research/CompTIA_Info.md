## What is CompTIA
So what makes CompTIA so praised in tech jobs and how it can help you in the technology community. What the industry has seen  
is that provided a industry standard unit of measurement for technical knowledge we're able to better focus on the large scale  
industry needs. That doesn't mean that CompTIA cannot serve even enthusiasts that are look to have a better understanding for
hobby projects. CompTIA is ranked the number one most desired technical certificate on United States based job boards (CompTIA, n.d.).  
As if there were not enough CompTIA provides the foundational skills to get you moving in any technical skillset with certifications  
in [cyber security](https://www.comptia.org/en-us/certifications/security/), [general knowledge](https://www.comptia.org/en-us/certifications/a/), and even [cloud essentials](https://www.comptia.org/en-us/certifications/cloud-essentials-v2).

With CompTIA you're provided two forms of education; the first being a CompCERT which allows an individual to undergo a provided  
educational environment. The benefits of a CompCert is allowing learners to gain needed context without on the job experience. This  
can be ideal for people entering the technology community for the first time and need a foothold.
